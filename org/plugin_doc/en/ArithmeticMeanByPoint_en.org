*Description:*

- Arithmetic mean for each point of all the fields received

*Iteration method:*

- Point-by-point

*Dependencies:*

- At least 2 different fields

*Result(s):*

- The mean of the fields received from input named "MEAN"

*Algorithm:*

#+begin_quote
  For N fields Fn , (n=1,N)

  The arithmetic mean of the N fields received from input is expressed
  for each point (i,j,k) as :

  \(\mbox{ $MEAN(i,j,k) = \frac {\sum_{n=1}^{N} F_n(i,j,k)}{N}$}\)
