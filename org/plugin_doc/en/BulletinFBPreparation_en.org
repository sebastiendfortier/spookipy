*Description:*

- Preparation of wind and temperature data, interpolated on an ensemble
  of Canadian stations and at 3000, 6000, 9000, 12000 and 18000 heights
  (in feet), in order to write the FBCN CWAO bulletins at 06, 12 and
  24h, and/or to produce the imagery for aviation

*Iteration method:*

- Does not apply

*Dependencies:*

- UU wind component (along the X axis)\\
- VV wind component (along the Y axis)\\
- Air temperature, TT\\
- Geopotential height, GZ\\
  \\
  */Note:/* The wind modulus (UV) and the meteorological wind direction
  (WD) cannot be provided in dependencies to this plug-in (see
  algorithm).

*Result(s):*

- Wind modulus UV (knots) calculated at the stations and at 3000, 6000,
  9000, 12000 and 18000 heights (in feet)
- Meteorological wind direction WD (deg) calculated at the stations and
  at 3000, 6000, 9000, 12000 and 18000 heights (in feet)
- Air temperature TT (deg C), interpolated at the stations and at 3000,
  6000, 9000, 12000 and 18000 heights (in feet)
- Geopotential height GZ (dam) at the the surface, interpolated at the
  stations
- TerrainElevation field (feet) regrouping the terrain elevation of each
  of the stations
- StationAlphaID field (maximum of 4 letters) regrouping the
  identification codes of each of the stations
- FictiveStationFlag boolean field indicating the real or fictitious
  status of each of the stations

*Algorithm:*

- Interrogation of the database of stations to extract at each of the
  stations used for the FB bulletins : The latitudes of the stations
  (signed decimal degrees) The longitudes of the stations (signed
  decimal degrees)
- Bi-cubic horizontal interpolation at the selected stations of the UU,
  VV, TT and GZ fields
- Linear vertical interpolation of the UU, VV, and TT fields at 3000,
  6000, 9000, 12000 and 18000 heights (in feet), converted into meters,
  for the interpolation of geometric height
- Calculation of UV and WD, from UU and VV at each point (lat,lon)
  associated to each station, defined on a reference grid of "cloud of
  points" type (corresponding to a L grid type in the particular case of
  standard files)
- Interrogation of the database to obtain the following additional
  fields, necessary to the writing of the bulletins : The terrain
  elevation of each station (meters) The identification code of each
  station (maximum of 4 letters) A boolean field indicating for each of
  the stations if it is or is not a fictitious station
