*Description:*

- Calculation of value differences of a given field for each grid point.
  The difference can be calculated in three different ways on each axis
  of the grid :

  - centered distance    : for one given point, difference of the value
    of the field between the previous point and the next point
  - forward distance      : for one given point, difference of the value
    of the field between this point and the next point
  - backward distance   : for one given point, difference of the value
    of the field between this point and the previous point

*Iteration method:*

- Point-by-point

*Dependencies:*

- A field on a grid or at least on one of the calculation axis (X,Y,Z)

*Result(s):*

- Central, forward or backward difference(s) of a field for each grid
  point.

*Algorithm:*

#+begin_example
  For F a given field and N its dimension along a given axis X ("axis" key)
  For n (n=1, N), the point from where we want to calculate the central, forward or backward difference of the field F.
  The calculation along the X axis results in :
          If differenceType = CENTERED then
              F(1) = F(2) - F(1)
              F(n) = F(n+1) - F(n-1) for 2 <= n <= N-1
              F(N) = F(N) - F(N-1)
          Else if differenceType = FORWARD then
              F(N) = F(N) - F(N-1)
              F(n) = F(n+1) - F(n) for 1 <= n <= N-1
          Else if differenceType = BACKWARD then
              F(1) = F(2) - F(1)
              F(n) = F(n) - F(n-1) for 2 <= n <= N
          Endif
