*Description:*

- Calculation of the modulus and the direction of a vector
- The direction of the vector can be calculated with the trigonometric
  convention or with the meteorological convention (where the vector is
  coming from with respect to north)

*Iteration method:*

- Point-by-point

*Dependencies:*

- A component of a vector along the X axis
- A component of the same vector along the Y axis */Notes:/*

  - Be certain to have selected, beforehand, only the components of the
    vector of which we want to calculate the modulus and the
    direction.\\
  - The components received from the dependencies must be named in
    alphabetical order to be associated correctly with the components
    along the X and Y axis, respectively.

*Result(s):*

- The vector modulus, MOD, which has the same units as the dependencies
- The vector direction, DIR (deg)

*Algorithm:*

#+begin_quote
  For MOD, the modulus of a vector with horizontal components x and y
  :\\
     MOD   =   \(\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}\)\\
  \\
  For DIR, the direction of that same vector :\\
     If the direction is calculated with the trigonometric convention
  (--orientationType TRIG), then :\\
       DIR   =   \(\frac{180}{\pi}\) atan2(y,x)\\
       if DIR < 0, DIR = DIR + 360\\
     If the direction is calculated with the meteorological convention
  (--orientationType WIND), then :\\
       the gduvfwd function of the EZSCINT library is used to calculate
  the direction of where the vector is coming from with respect to north
