*Description:*

- Reading of standard file(s) and conversion into the system's internal
  memory structure.
- The information associated to the spacial representation (also called
  "meta-information"), is read automatically and is conserved by default
  throughout the calculations.
- [[https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Spooki/RelationsSpookiFSTD][The
  variable dictionary]] is consulted during the reading of each variable
  and its corresponding unit is associated by default.\\
  */Note :/*if two identical records are present in the input file, only
  the first will be kept

*Iteration method:*

- Does not apply

*Dependance:*

- One or more valid standard file(s) */Note :/*The forecast hour is
  extracted with the help of the record descriptors DEET and NPAS and
  not directly from the record descriptor IP2

*Result(s):*

- Standard files received from input converted into internal memory
  structure

*Algorithm:*
