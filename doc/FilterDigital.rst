Description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Apply a digital filter of Stencil type on a data set.
-  The filter, applied on one given point, in one direction of the
   given field, is characterized by a list of weights (odd number)
   symmetrical to the considered point and to the number of times
   it is applied.
-  The filter is applied successively in each direction of the
   given field.

Iteration method:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Point-by-point

Dependencies:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  A meteorological field on a grid.

Result(s):
~~~~~~~~~~

-  The filtered values of the meteorological field.

Algorithm:
~~~~~~~~~~

   For F, a given field of components F(i), in the direction NI
   (i=1,NI).


   For :math:`w_n, (n=1,N)` a list of N weights associated to the digital filter applied on the F field, which the result
   :math:`F^*` on each component is expressed as :

   :math:`F^*(i) = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n F(i - {\scriptstyle[\frac{N+1}{2}- n]})} {\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n}, 2 \leq i \leq NI-1`

   This operation is repeated ("repetitions" key), in the
   direction NI, as many times as the specified number in
   parameter.

   We proceed in the same way in each direction of the F field,
   successively.

   Note: : in the case of a 2D field, the algorithm is first
   applied in the direction NI, and then in the direction NJ.
